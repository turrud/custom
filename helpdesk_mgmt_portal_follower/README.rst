Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Known Caveats
-------------

1. **Spam Risks**:

   - Allowing users to input any email address could lead to spam if
     unintended recipients are included.

2. **Privacy Concerns**:

   - Users may inadvertently share sensitive information by adding
     followers without the consent of the email address owners.
   - This feature could expose email addresses to individuals who should
     not have access to that information.

3. **User Misunderstanding**:

   - End-users may not fully understand the implications of adding
     multiple email addresses, potentially leading to confusion or
     misuse.

If you plan to use this module, it is essential to inform users about
the importance of carefully selecting followers to add. This process
will help maintain privacy and limit unnecessary notifications.
