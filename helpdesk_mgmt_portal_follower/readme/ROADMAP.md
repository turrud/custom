## Known Caveats

1. **Spam Risks**:
   - Allowing users to input any email address could lead to spam if unintended recipients are included.

2. **Privacy Concerns**:
   - Users may inadvertently share sensitive information by adding followers without the consent of the email address owners.
   - This feature could expose email addresses to individuals who should not have access to that information.

3. **User Misunderstanding**:
   - End-users may not fully understand the implications of adding multiple email addresses, potentially leading to confusion or misuse.

If you plan to use this module, it is essential to inform users about the importance of carefully selecting followers to add. This process will help maintain privacy and limit unnecessary notifications.
